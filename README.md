## Snake Finder is an image recognition app that quickly identifies snakes and displays information about them! 
### Using technologies such as Google Colab, ImageAI, Pytorch, Flask, Pandas, the ChatGPT API, and more, we trained a custom image detection model with a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goelyash/165-different-snakes-species/data) consisting of 150 various snake species. Informatino provided about each snake includes its name, country of origin, scientific name, whether it's venomous or not, and a short description given by ChatGPT. Our app is built on a user-friendly web interface using Flask, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.
